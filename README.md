# 2048 Game

In this game, the goal is to merge cells with identical numbers until you reach the number **2048**. The cells contain integer values that are powers of two, starting from 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).

The game board is a 4 x 4 grid that holds up to 16 cells. If the grid fills up and no further moves (such as merging cells) are possible, the game ends.
